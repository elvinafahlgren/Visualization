    "\n",
    "To reach the functionality of Blender from Python you have to load the `bpy` module. Your should also load the `math` and `mathutil` modules, as Blender heavily use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blender comes shipped with its own Python version (within Blender). This is to make sure that Python connects properly to the blender software. There are (at least) two ways of using Python for scripting in Blender.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Python from within Blender\n",
    "\n",
    "Read about the [Blender Python Console](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/python_console.html) and the [Text Editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/text_editor.html).\n",
    "This is the easiest way to run Python commands for Blender. However, I find that the text editor in Blender is not so good, and also it is a bit tricky to debug code using the Blender Python editor and console.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connecting Blender Python to the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to connect Blender to the notebook. This can be achieved via the [`blender-notebook` module](https://pypi.org/project/blender-notebook/). Note that this is a third party solution, so there's not guarantee that it works (depends on your version of Blender and Python etc). The easiest way to do this is to first create a conda *environment* specifically for Blender. If you open a new terminal, this is how you do it (assuming you're using Blender version 2.93):\n",
    "```\n",
    "> conda create --name blender python=3.9.1 numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn\n",
    "> conda activate blender\n",
    "```\n",
    "then install `blender-notebook` is [instructed here](https://pypi.org/project/blender-notebook/) using `pip`. If you then start a notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "> jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "you can start a Blender Python session by selecting `new -> blender`."

    "## Task 1: first Blender animation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will create your first, very simple Blender animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First read about [Animation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/animation/introduction.html) and [Keyframes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/animation/keyframes/introduction.html) in Blender. Also check out the [official video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6) on animation. Start with the 'Keyframes' and 'Timeline' tutorials. You can also watch 'Dopesheet' and 'Graph Editor' if you like.\n",
    "- Create an object in Blender and place it at the origin (the default box will do, but you can also create something else, for example a doughnut as in the Blender Guru tutorial).\n",
    "- Open a [Timeline Editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/timeline.html), then add a keyframe at frame 1 by going to the [3D View in Object Mode](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/3dview/modes.html) and then pressing \"I\" then \"Location\". This adds a keyframe for the location of your object.\n",
    "- Now go to the Timeline Editor and select frame 250. Move your object to some new location (by pressing \"G\" + mouse move + \"Enter\"). Insert now another keyframe for the location of your object.\n",
    "- Play your movie by pressing the play button in the Timeline Editor.\n",
    "- Render your animation. Make sure that you use MPEG-4 as encoder, and the file extension should be .mp4: in the 'Scene' properties, in the 'Output' pane select File Format 'FFmpeg video', and then under the 'Encoding' pane select 'MPEG-4'. The default output folder in the 'Output' pane is '/tmp/' which probably not what you want: change to a more suitable folder. To create the animation, then choose 'Render Animation' under the 'Render' menu. The default name of the movie created is '0001-0250.mp4', but you can change this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Rendering time can be very long, especially on the Linux computers (they seem to be very slow). Thus, it is a good idea to render just a few frames first to make sure it looks good. (Choose 'Render' instead of 'Render Animation' in the 'Render' menu to render single images instead of the whole animation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The movie you get will be rather dull. To spice it up, you can add materials and more advanced lightning to your scene: see [official video guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6) on materials and lightning. Blender Guru also has good tutorials for this. This is not part of this exercise though."

    "\n",

    "The easiest way is to first create a sphere and then flatten or extrude it differently in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions. \n",
    "The task is to create a Python script that solves the Euler equations for a rigid body in quaternion formulation using the Lie-Euler method (as explained in the presentation), and from this solution generate rotation keyframes in Blender for the object in your scene. The physically correct way to do this is to first calculate the moments of intertia for your object. However, as this is a little complicated to do in Blender, I give you the moments of inertia tensor: it is diagonal with diagonal elements $(0.5, 2, 4)$. \n",
    "This corresponds to your ellipsoid object. Here is the data for the full problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The initial data is $q_0 = (1,0,0,0)$ and $\\omega=(10^{-2},1,0)$.\n",

    "- The stepsize is $h = 0.01$.\n",
    "- Make your simulation so that each frame in Blender corresponds to 10 time steps with the Lie-Euler method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some additional information that will help you get on track:\n",
    "- Make sure everything from the `math` and `mathutils` modules are loaded. They support quaternions through the class `Quaternion`. For example, to create and multiply two quaternions you do the following\n",
    "```python\n",
    "q1 = Quaternion((1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0))\n",
    "q2 = Quaternion((0.0, 0.5, 1.5, -0.5))\n",
    "q3 = q1@q2\n",
    "```\n",
    "- To select that Blender should use quaternions for rotations for the object in the variable `myobj`, do\n",
    "`myobj.rotation_mode = 'QUATERNION'`. After that, to get or set the quaternion representing the orientation of the currently selected object, do \n",
    "`q = myobj.rotation_quaternion`, or, to set it, do\n",
    "`myobj.rotation_quaternion = q`.\n",
    "- For the `omega` variable (3 vector) it is convenient to use the `Vector` class (also available through `mathutils`). This class also supports the dot and cross products. For example, to create two vectors and take their cross product, do \n",
    "```python\n",
    "omega1 = Vector((1.0, -3.0, 0.0))\n",
    "omega2 = Vector((0.0, 2.0, -2.0))\n",
    "omega3 = omega1.cross(omega2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Likewise, matrices can be created from the `Matrix` class. To construct the diagonal inertia tensor, do \n",
    "`I = Matrix(((0.5,0,0),(0,2,0),(0,0,4)))`. Its inverse can be computed with\n",
    "`I.inverted()`. Multiplication with a `omega` (object from class `Vector`) is obtained as\n",
    "`I@omega`.\n",
    "- The `qexp` function, returning the quaternion corresponding to the matrix exponential ([see slides](https://slides.com/kmodin/mmg640-velocity-16-18?token=eol1jbFe)) is obtained by sending in a vector of length 3 (corresponding to `omega`) to the constructor of the `Quaternion` class. For example, if `omeg` is a `Vector` object, then `qexp(omega)` is computed by\n",
