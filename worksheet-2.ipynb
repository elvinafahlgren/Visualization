Furthermore, to handle tabular data (such as the data in an Excel-sheet), we shall use the module [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Pandas is an open source data analysis toolbox that connects well with Matplotlib and in particular with Seaborn. Both Pandas and Seaborn are part of the Anaconda Python distribution and can be considered \"standard\" modules (meaning a lot of code use these modules)."
